# Example LSP in Rust

An exploration into LSP/LSIF written in Rust. This will target Python and integration with VS Code (my preferred Text Editor).

Microsoft makes it very easy to start integrating VSCode with Python using a [GitHub template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-tools-extension-template?tab=readme-ov-file).

Their template is copied into the `client` folder.
